<p>Financial advisors are responsible for assisting clients in managing their money,
investments, and financial goals, helping them make informed decisions.
In terms of remuneration, financial advisors typically receive a commission for the
products and services they sell.</p>

<p>The two main types of commission are the classic fee setting and the fixed fee. The
classic fee setting is based on the principle of earning a commission based both on
the invested amount and the performance of the investment. This means that the more the client risks, the more he can gain, the more the financial advisor can gain.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fixed fee involves the advisor earning a set amount,
regardless of the risk that the client sustains. This means that the advisor’s
earnings do not depend on the investment's level of risk.</p>
