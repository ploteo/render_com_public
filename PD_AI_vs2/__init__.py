a simple PD with assistance from AI. In one case the machine is instanced on "selfish" in the other on "cooperative"
This version allows for repeated rounds nd integrates what the other does

The treatments are the following:

TYPE: the AI is instructed to suggest the player to choose A
    - SELFISH: the AI is instructed to suggest the player to choose A
    - COOPERATIVE: the AI is instructed to suggest the player to choose B
MATCHING: 
    - SAME: both are same type (2 cooperatives or 2 selfish)
    - DIFF: both are different type
