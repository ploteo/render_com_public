<p>Your country asks you to allocate an initial endowment towards three specific policies. Furthermore, as
part of its taxation system the state also promises to match 5% of your donation towards a charity in that
field. </p>
<p>For each stage a specific policy proposal will be presented and we ask you to consider how much you are
willing to contribute towards its implementation.</p>
<p>Each stage consists of 5 rounds, at the end of each round you will be able to see how much the other
citizens decided to contribute.</p>
<p>Your initial endowment will be 100 tokens, and it will be renewed at the beginning of each round.
At the end of each stage you will receive your payoff.</p>
