<div class="container box">
<p>You will be presented with different charitable causes. For each case, you will be
provided with an initial endowment of 100 experimental currency units (ECU; 1 ECU
= 0,1â‚¬).</p>

<p>You will be asked to state how many ECU you are willing to donate to each cause.
You can only enter whole/integer numbers.</p>
<p>After the experiment, a random selection will determine one of your allocated amounts
for an actual donation, and you'll receive the remaining difference from your initial
endowment.</p>
<p><i>Example:</i> Out of the provided 100 ECU, you allocated 50 ECU to cause X, which was
randomly selected for an actual donation on your behalf. Hence, 50 ECU will be
donated to cause X, and you'll receive the remaining 50 ECU.</p>
