<div class="container box">

<p>This phase of the experiment is composed of three different rounds. In each of them, you will be assigned an initial
endowment of 100 tokens and will be required to take your investment decision according to the rules explained before.</p>

<p>In this phase you will participate in a tournament with the other participants of the experiment according to the payoff
obtained in each round. Those participants who will rank in the first three positions will gain an additional monetary
compensation according to the following scheme:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
1st position will gain 1.5% of x
    </li>
    <li>
2nd position will gain 1.0% of x
    </li>
    <li>
3rd position will gain 0.5% of x
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In case in which there are more than one player that will rank in one of the first 3 positions, the additional gain will be randomly divided with 50% chances.</p>

<p>The screen will be divided in two parts: firstly, you will be required to indicate the share of the initial endowment that you are willing to invest. Following this, you will be asked to indicate the chosen investment option among the alternatives. Once you have made your choices, you can click
<button type="button" name="btn_submit" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
    <span style="font-size:14pt">Confirm</span>
</button>. The following screen will show you the three participants that ranked in the highest position in the round, the position that you have ranked in the tournament and the consequent payoff obtained, specifying whether or not you have gained an additional compensation. You can then click on the button <button type="button" name="btn_submit" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large"> <span style="font-size:14pt">Continue</span>
</button> in order to proceed to next round of the phase.</p>

<p>In this phase, the payoff for each round will be computed according to the following function:</p>

<p><b>Ï€ = share of initial endowment not invested + outcome of the investment options chosen + additional gain conditional to the ranking</b></p> 

<p>Final outcome of this phase will be the payoff of one randomly selected round among the three played.</p>
