<div class="container box">

<p>This phase of the experiment is composed of three different rounds. In each of them, you will be
assigned an initial endowment of 100 tokens and will be required to take your investment decision
according to the rules explained before.</p>

<p>In this phase you will participate in a tournament with the other participants of the experiment
according to the payoff obtained in each round: higher earnings result in a higher position in the
ranking.</p>

<p>The screen will be divided in two parts: firstly, you will be required to indicate the share of the initial
endowment that you are willing to invest. Secondly, you will be asked to indicate the chosen investment
option among the alternatives.</p>

<p>Once you have made your choices, you can click <button type="button" name="btn_submit" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
    <span style="font-size:14pt">Confirm</span>
</button>. The following screen will show you
the participants that ranked in the first three positions. Below, it will be indicated the position that
you ranked and your payoff for the round. In case in which there are more than one player that will
rank in one of the first 3 positions, they will share the same position. Rank of participants will show
their different outcome obtained, but it won’t disclose neither their invested share x nor the chosen
investment option. You can then click on the button <button type="button" name="btn_submit" value="True" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
    <span style="font-size:14pt">Continue</span>
</button> in order to proceed to next
round of the phase.</p>

<p>In this phase, the payoff for each round will be computed according to the following function:</p>

<p><b>π = share of initial endowment not invested + outcome of the investment options chosen</b></p> 

<p>Final outcome of this phase will be the payoff of one randomly selected round among the three played.</p>
