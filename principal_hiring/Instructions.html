<!-- this is treatment -->
<p>You will see the number of problems correctly solved by the two Candidates in the decoding task described on the previous page.</p>
<p>You will also see the candidatesâ€™ beliefs about their likelihood of being better than another random candidate.</p> <!-- shoudl we mention that it is not the one they are matched with-->

<p>Below is an example of what you will see on the next screen.</p>

<p>Your task is to choose which of the two Candidates <i>to "hire"</i> (by clicking on the corresponding button).
</p>
<p>What does <i>to "hire"</i> mean?</p>

<ul>
    <li><p>In a second stage, both candidates repeated the coding task for {{time}} seconds.</p></li>
    <li><p>Both candidates were informed that if they were hired by you, they would earn {{piece_rate}} for every problem they solved correctly.</p></li>
    <li><p>For each problem solved correctly by the candidate you hire you will earn <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">{{C.MULTIPLIER}}</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You will choose which of the two candidates to hire, before knowing their actual performance in the second stage. You will only know the performance of the candidates in the first stage, but only the performance in the second stage will define your actual payment.</p>
