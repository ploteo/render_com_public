<!-- ROUND 1 AGENT-->

<div class="container box">
<p>You will be paired with two other participants who took part in a previous session. We call these participants <b>Candidates</b> and explain below what they did in their session.</p>
<p>In the next screen, we explain to you what your task is today.</p>

<h2>Candidates' Task</h2>

<p>The candidates participated in an earlier session and were asked to solve a series of problems. The problems all have the same structure.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example of the problem: one needs to "convert" the numbers reported in the lower panel into letters
according to the conversion table in the upper panel.
    </p>
<p>
<center><img src="{{ static "demo_task.png" }}" width=400/></center>
</p>
<p>In this example, the solution to this problem is: <i>MDQEP</i></p>
<p>
The candidates had {{time}} seconds to solve as many problems as they could.
They earned {{piece_rate}} for every problem they solved correctly.
</p>

<p><!-- ADDED THESE FOR TREATMENT HOMOGENEITY-->
The candidates you will be viewing were paired due to their comparable performance in the task.
</p>

<h2>Candidates' Beliefs</h2>

<p>Each candidate was matched with another candidate who and was asked to estimate the
    probability that he/she correctly solved more problems than the other one (that is, their beliefs). </p>

<p>The closer the probability that they reported to the actual outcome of the comparison, the higher the likelihood of
    earning {{C.EARN_BEL}}. We conceived a system of monetary incentives to encourage them to report their beliefs truthfully.</p>
