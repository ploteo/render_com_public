<div class="container box">
<p>You will now be paired with two other participants who took part in a previous session. We identify these participants as <b>Candidates</b> and explain here what they did in their session.</p>
<p>In the next screen, we explain to you what your task is today.</p>

<h2>Candidates' Task</h2>

<p>The candidates took part in an earlier session and were asked to solve a series of problems. The problems all have the same structure.
</p>
<p>
The following is an example of the problem: one needs to "convert" the numbers reported in the lower panel into letters
according to the conversion table in the upper panel.
    </p>
<p>
<center><img src="{{ static "demo_task.png" }}" width=400/></center>
</p>
<p>In this example, the solution to this problem is: <i>MDQEP</i></p>
<p>
The candidates had {{time}} seconds to solve as many problems as they could.
They earned {{piece_rate}} for every problem they solved correctly.
</p>

<h2>Candidates' Beliefs</h2>

<p>Each candidate was matched with another candidate and was asked to estimate the
    probability that he/she performed better than the other in the task. </p>

<p>The closer the probability that they reported to the actual outcome of the comparison, the higher the likelihood of
    earning {{C.EARN_BEL}}. We conceived a system of incentives that encouraged a truthful report of beliefs.</p>
