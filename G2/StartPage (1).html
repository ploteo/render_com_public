<p>Welcome to our experiment!</p>
<p>In this simulation, you will play the role of a student living in a city with several student apartments. Your goal is
to reach the university by choosing a means of transportation.</p>

<p>You will have three means of transportation to choose from, each with its own cost, utility and emissions. Your task is
to choose, in each round, which means of transportation you want to use.
The game will consist of multiple rounds. In each round, you will get an endowment of 30 points to pay for your chosen
transportation method.</p>

<p>All information will be presented in the following form. Please note that the values might change during the game:</p>

{{ if player.type == 'A' }}

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th> </th>
            <th>Cost</th>
            <th>Utility</th>
            <th>Emissions</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Car</td>
            <td>30</td>
            <td>140</td>
            <td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>10</td>

        </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Your payoff per round is calculated as follows: Pi = (Endowment - Cost) + Utility</p>
<p>At the end of the game your total payoff will be given by the sum of the payoffs in each round.
1 unit of payoff corresponds to â‚¬0.01.</p>


{{ if player.type == 'A' }}

<p>Be aware that each means of transportation has associated emissions.</p>
<p>These emissions contribute to the overall environmental impact.</p>
<p>Every time the aggregate pollution of <i>your apartment</i> exceeds the threshold of <b>13</b>, the utility will be reduced for all
future rounds and, therefore, also the payoff of each participant.</p>
