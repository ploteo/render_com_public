<!-- ROUND 2 AGENT-->

<div class="container box">
<p>
    You will now face the same task you faced in Part 1 (see example below)
</p>
<center><img src="{{ static "demo_task.png" }}" width=400 /></center>

<p>
    You have <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{time}}</span> seconds to solve as many problems as you can.
</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<p>The earnings in this part are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your performance in Part 1 will be displayed to a participant, that we call Player B, in a session that will take place in the afternoon. Together with your performance, the Player B will see the performance of another participant to the current session that performed similarly to you. 
    </li>
    <li>
    The Player B will choose whom to hire between you and the other. 
    </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
        If you hired, you earn <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{piece_rate}}</span> for every problem you solve correctly. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are not hired, you earn nothing in this Part, irrespective of the number of problems solved.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Player B earns <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{piece_rate}}</span> for every problem solved by the hired participant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will solve the problems before knowing whether you are hired or not. You will be notified tomorrow if you were
hired or not (and of the associated earnings in this part).</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>

<p>
    When you are ready, click on the START button to start solving the problems.
