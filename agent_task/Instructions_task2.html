    You will now face the same task you faced in Part 1 (see the example below)
</p>

<p>
    You now have <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{time}}</span> seconds to solve as many problems as you can.

<!------------------------------------------------------>
<p>The earnings in this Part are determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <!-- this is treatment performance-->
    <li> 
        Your performance in Part 1 will be displayed to another participant, whom we call Player B, in a session that will take place later today. Together with your performance, Player B will also see the performance of another participant in the current session whose performance in Part 1 was similar to yours. 
    </li>
    <!--   -->
    <li>
    Player B will choose whom to hire between you and the other participant. 
    </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
        If you are hired, you earn an additional <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{piece_rate}}</span> for every problem you solve correctly in this Part. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If the other is hired, you earn nothing for this Part.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Player B earns <span style="font-weight: bold;">{{piece_rate}}</span> for every problem solved by the hired participant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will solve the problems before knowing whether you are hired or not. You will be notified tomorrow if you were
hired or not (and of the associated earnings for this Part).</p>
