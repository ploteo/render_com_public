        <p>You are randomly matched with another participant to the task you just saw in part 1. We ask you to estimate the probability
        that you performed better than the other in the task. </p>
      
        <p>Given your estimate, you are informed about the likelihood of earning {{C.EARN_BEL}}, both in case you would be actually better or worse
        than the other. The information is updated as you move your slider.</p>

        <p>The closer the probability that you report to the actual outcome of the comparison, the higher the likelihood of earning {{C.EARN_BEL}}.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Now click on the bar</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">move the slider </span> to select the probability that you performed better than the other. Once done, click on SUBMIT button. </p>
