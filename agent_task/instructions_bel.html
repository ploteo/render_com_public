        <p>We randomly matched you with another participant in the task you just performed in part 1. We ask you to estimate the probability
        that you correctly solved more problems than the matched participant. 
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You must click on the bar</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">move the slider </span> to select the probability that you performed better than the other. 
    </p>

        <p>The closer the probability you select to the actual outcome of the comparison, the higher the likelihood of earning an additional {{C.EARN_BEL}}.</p>
      
        <p>Given your estimate, below the slider, you can see the likelihood of earning {{C.EARN_BEL}}, both in case you would actually be better or worse
        than the matched participant. The information updates as you move the slider.</p>

      <p>Once done, click on SUBMIT button. </p>
